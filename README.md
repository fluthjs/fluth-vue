## Introduction

fluth-vue is a streaming programming library based on [fluth](https://github.com/fluthjs/fluth). It provides a series of practical stream methods and composable functions, deeply integrating the streaming programming paradigm with Vue's reactive system, fully enjoying the smooth development experience brought by streaming programming.

## Features

- 🌀 **Perfect Ecosystem Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Vue's reactivity, enjoying Vue's ecosystem and development tools
- 🌊 **Stream-based Programming**: Leverages fluth's powerful streaming programming capabilities to implement reactive programming for logic
- 🌈 **Stream Rendering**: More fine-grained stream rendering capabilities, giving you control over rendering timing and frequency
- 🤖 **Development Experience**: Achieves ultimate debugging experience through plugins, enjoying the development experience brought by streaming programming

## Applicable Versions

- **Vue 3.2.0 and above**:
  - ✅ All stream subscription behaviors in Vue setup will automatically cancel subscriptions when components are destroyed
  - ✅ Stream data has reactive capabilities and can seamlessly integrate with Vue's reactive system
- **Vue 2.7.0 ~ 3.1.x versions**:
  - ❌ Stream [subscription behaviors](https://fluthjs.github.io/fluth-doc/en/guide/base.html#subscription-nodes) need to be manually [canceled](https://fluthjs.github.io/fluth-doc/en/guide/base.html#cancel-subscription), cannot automatically cancel subscriptions
  - ✅ Stream data has reactive capabilities and can seamlessly integrate with Vue's reactive system
- **Vue versions below 2.7.0**:
  - ❌ Stream subscription behaviors need to be manually [canceled](https://fluthjs.github.io/fluth-doc/en/guide/base.html#cancel-subscription), cannot automatically cancel subscriptions
  - ❌ Stream data doesn't have reactive capabilities, need to use [toCompt](https://fluthjs.github.io/fluth-vue/en/useFluth/#tocompt) to convert to reactive data

## Installation

```bash
npm install fluth-vue
# or
yarn add fluth-vue
# or
pnpm add fluth-vue
```

## Usage

```vue
<template>
  <div>{{ stream$ }}</div>
  <div>{{ tips$ }}</div>

  <button @click="updateStream">click</button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { $ } from "fluth-vue";

const words = ["word", "i", "am", "fluth", "vue", "welcome", "to", "use"];

const stream$ = $("hello");

const tips$ = stream$
  .pipe(debounce(00))
  .then((value) => `debounce: ${value}`)
  .pipe(filter((value) => value.includes("welcome")))
  .then((value) => `filter: ${value}`);

const updateStream = () => {
  if (words.length > 0) {
    stream$.next(`${stream$.value} ${words.shift()}`);
  }
};
</script>
```

```

```
